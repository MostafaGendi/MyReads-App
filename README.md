# MyReads App

This project is an online library that lets you track your reading activities.

## Getting Started

First you have to install npm to be able to use this app. Then, you can check the magic library which is full of hundreds of great books you may like to read. Add books to your library and track your activity smoothly and easily.

## How to use

Open the app, and check the library we have noticed before, choose which books you want to read from the little arrow right down the book thumbnail. Choose a shelf to your book from three shelves:
  * Currently Reading  
  * Want To Read  
  * Read  
You can move any book any time to the shelf you like.

Book status is saved along all the app, the main page and search page.
